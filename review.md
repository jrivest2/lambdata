For example_module:

I like that you fixed the spelling of "destroyer" instead of typing it how it was in class.
df_cleaner is empty of functionality
your list of favorite numbers should have spaces in it

For oop_example:

There are too many return carriages before you define BareMinimumClass
Your line "super().__init__(name,weight,diet_type)" under Sloth should have spaces between the attributes
Similarly, you should add spaces between the attributes in your User object instances
Everything else looks great, though!
