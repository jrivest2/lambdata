# lambdata
A package that was created in Unit-3 Sprint-1 to learn about packages

# What is it:
My package was made for my own personal educational purposes. A lot of example files were simply made for the practice of making a package. The rsnn module is where I've spent the most time outside of class (Lambda School DS track). "RSNN" stands for Random Shuffle Number Null. This is because the class DF (that inherits from pandas.DataFrame) that I wrote only has 2 methods:
 - randomShuffle()
 - numNull()

My randomShuffle method randomly shuffles any given pandas dataframe. My numNull method will return the total number of null values in and given pandas dataframe.
